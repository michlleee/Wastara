            At Wastara, we believe cleaner cities start with empowered communities.
            Our platform was created to give everyday citizens a simple, effective
            way to report unmanaged trash in their surroundings. Whether it's a
            packed bin or an illegal dump spot, your report helps local organizers
            and waste management teams act faster and smarter. Wastara is designed
            to be lightweight, accessible, and responsive â€” a progressive web app
            that works seamlessly on any device. We aim to connect the public with
            those who keep our cities clean, using tech as a bridge for civic impact.
